# Abstract Algebra Problem Sets

Personal answers to the problem sets presented in Harvard's free online
abstract algebra course. All problems come from Michael Artin's *Algebra*.
Unless explicitly noted, all solutions are my own, and may therefore be wrong!
To the best of my knowledge though, they're all correct
